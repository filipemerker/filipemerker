### Hi there 👋

I'm a Javascript Engineer with more than 9 years of experience, currently working full-time with 📚 *Micro-frontends, Typescript, Node, React & Redux, and tests (E2E, integration and unit)*.

I've done all sorts of cool stuff throughout those years and some of them are listed below. Enjoy 😊
